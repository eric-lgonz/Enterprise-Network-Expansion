# Enterprise-Network-Expansion-and-VLAN-Implementation

In this project, I will demonstrate how to:

- Integrate a new switch block into an existing enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer, simulating
real-world brownfield network expansion
- Configure VLANs, trunks, Layer 3 routing, SVIs, EtherChannel, and first-hop redundancy protocols to support
resilient network growth
- Apply the access-distribution-core design model to optimize performance, scalability, and manageability in a
multi-layer enterprise environment

This project will be split into 6 parts, with each section focusing on a different phase of the enterprise network upgrade to keep things organized and easy to follow.

<h2>What is Cisco Packet Tracer?</h2>

<a href="https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer"> Cisco Packet Tracer<a/> is a comprehensive, widely used, and free network simulation software tool. It enables users to design, configure, and troubleshoot network topologies without the need for physical hardware. Cisco packet tracer offers realistic simulation and visualization for modern computer networks, making it ideal for simulating both greenfield and brownfield computer network environments. Feel free to check out their <a href="https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer"> website<a/> for more information about Cisco Packet Tracer and its capabilities.

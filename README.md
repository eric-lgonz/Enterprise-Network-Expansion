# Enterprise-Network-Expansion-and-VLAN-Implementation

In this project, I will demonstrate how to:

- Integrate a new switch block into an existing enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer, simulating
real-world brownfield network expansion
- Configure VLANs, trunks, Layer 3 routing, SVIs, EtherChannel, and first-hop redundancy protocols to support
resilient network growth
- Apply the access-distribution-core design model to optimize performance, scalability, and manageability in a
multi-layer enterprise environment

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<h2>What is Cisco Packet Tracer?</h2>

<a href="https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer"> Cisco Packet Tracer<a/> is a comprehensive, widely used, and free network simulation software tool. Cisco packet tracer offers realistic simulation and visualization for modern computer networks, making it ideal for simulating both greenfield and brownfield computer network environments.
